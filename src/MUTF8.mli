(** Creates a MUTF8 string from a sequence of UTF-16 values. Any
    sequence of UTF-16 values is valid. Numbers outside the range
    of 0 to 0xFFFF will raise BatUChar.Out_of_range. *)

(** Creates a MUTF8 string from a sequence of unichars. The sequence
    may contain high-plane characters and/or unpaired surrogates but
    must not contain paired surrogates: providing a sequence with
    paired surrogates will produce a malformed MUTF8 object. *)

   codepoint 0 in MUTF8, this is different from comparing the
   bytestring representations. *)

(** Traverse a UTF8, MUTF8, or CESU string as a sequence of integer
   values. For UTF8, these will be UCS32 code points; for CESU or
   MUTF8, these will be UTF16 values. The sequence is evaluated
   lazily, and may raise BatUTF8.Malformed_code if it reaches a byte
   sequence invalid in (M)UTF8. *)

(** Convert a UTF-16 sequence to a UCS-32 sequence by combining

(** Convert a UTF-16 sequence to a UCS-32 sequence by combining

    in particular, integers greater than 0xFFFF are still
